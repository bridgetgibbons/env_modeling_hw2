# Bringing in our model from our .R file:

```{r}

source("")

```


# 3. 
## Loading in the climate data provided (clim.txt): 

```{r}



```


## Using our model to estimate how almond yield anomalies for each year in the record:

```{r}



```


## Graphing the results:

```{r}



```


# 4.
## Estimating the mean annual yield anomaly if the last 20 years had been 2C warmer:

```{r}



```

## Varying one of the parameters by sampling from a normal distribution; with mean the value from Lobell et al., (2006) and standard deviation 10% of the mean

```{r}



```

## Creating a box plot of mean annual yield anomaly for baseline and 2C climate (boxes show variation due to uncertainty in the parameter):

```{r}



```
